# Where data and biology meet

The Dalmolin Systems Biology Group advances biomedical knowledge through Bioinformatics and Systems Biology. Our mission is to unravel the intricate complexities of biological systems through innovative approaches and advanced methodologies. Committed to excellence, our team is dedicated to addressing a diverse array of biological challenges using the powerful lens of systems biology. Our reseach group is led by professor Rodrigo Dalmolin, Ph.D. and it is associated with graduate program in Bioinformatics from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN).
